# Wine Classification

### Overview
This project focuses on classifying different types of wine using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of chemical properties of wines, and the goal is to accurately predict the wine class based on these features.

### Dataset
The dataset contains 178 samples with 13 chemical attributes, including:
- Alcohol
- Malic Acid
- Ash
- Magnesium
- Total Phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid Phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color Intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline
The target variable represents three different classes of wine.

### Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values and ensured data cleanliness.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features.
- Standardized the data for better model performance.

### Machine Learning Models
The following models were implemented and evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression - A simple yet effective classification model.
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Used for its ability to handle complex decision boundaries.
3. Gradient Boosting - Applied to enhance predictive performance through ensemble learning.

### Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 97%, demonstrating effective classification of wines.

### Colclusion
This project successfully classified wine types with high accuracy using machine learning. The results highlight the importance of feature selection and model tuning in predictive analytics.
